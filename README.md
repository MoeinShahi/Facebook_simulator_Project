# Facebook_simulator_Project
A user management system called "Facebook simulator" works with a console command line for which it offers some operations such as :

1. Enter a new member's data
2. Find a member in the community
3. Delete a member from the community
4. List all the members who are invited by the same person
5. List all the Community Members
6. Exit the program!

The .txt file is used as a database in the console application
Once the program is run file called "Facebook.txt" is created to save data input from the user by following the format in the .txt file :

"<Name> <surename> <nickname> <birthplace> <birthday (YYYY, MM, DD)> <Inviter>"


Every row represents a user (member) of this community.
